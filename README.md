## 🗄️ Database Schema

The included SQLite database contains realistic e-commerce data:

### Core Tables
- **`customers`** - Customer information (id, name, email, created_at, region)
- **`orders`** - Order records (id, customer_id, order_date, status)
- **`order_items`** - Line items (id, order_id, product_id, quantity, unit_price_cents)
- **`products`** - Product catalog (id, name, category, description)
- **`payments`** - Payment records (id, order_id, amount_cents, method)
- **`refunds`** - Refund tracking (id, order_id, amount_cents, reason)

### Sample Business Metrics
- **Revenue calculation**: `sum(quantity * unit_price_cents) - refunds.amount_cents`
- **Customer lifetime value**: Total revenue per customer minus refunds
- **Product performance**: Revenue and units sold by product/category
- **Time-series analysis**: Weekly/monthly revenue trends

## 🛡️ Security Best Practices Demonstrated

### 1. Input Validation
```python
# Multi-layer validation approach
if re.search(r"\b(INSERT|UPDATE|DELETE|DROP|TRUNCATE|ALTER|CREATE|REPLACE)\b", s, re.I):
    return "ERROR: write operations are not allowed."

if ";" in s:
    return "ERROR: multiple statements are not allowed."

if not re.match(r"(?is)^\s*select\b", s):
    return "ERROR: only SELECT statements are allowed."
```

### 2. Result Set Limiting
```python
# Automatic LIMIT injection for performance
if not re.search(r"\blimit\s+\d+\b", s, re.I):
    s += " LIMIT 200"  # Conservative limit
```

### 3. Error Handling
```python
# Comprehensive error catching and reporting
try:
    result = conn.exec_driver_sql(s)
    # ... process results
except Exception as e:
    return f"ERROR: {e}"  # Safe error reporting
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"ModuleNotFoundError" for LangChain packages**
```bash
# Ensure virtual environment is activated and dependencies installed
source .venv/bin/activate  # or .venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**"OpenAI API key not found"**
```bash
# Verify .env file configuration
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and add: OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-key-here
```

**"Database file not found"**
```bash
# Reset the database
python scripts/reset_db.py
```

**Pydantic validation errors**
- Ensure you're using Python 3.8+ with compatible package versions
- Check that type annotations are properly formatted

### Getting Help

- Check the comprehensive inline documentation in each script
- Review error messages carefully - they provide specific guidance
- Test with simple queries first before attempting complex analytics
- Use the Jupyter notebook for interactive exploration
